# API Scripts

This directory contains scripts that interact with Pendle's API endpoints.

## Files

- `fetch-active-markets.ts`: Fetches the list of active markets from the Pendle API
- `fetch-market-data.ts`: Fetches detailed market data for each active market

## Usage

These scripts are used to gather market data through HTTP API calls rather than direct blockchain interactions.
